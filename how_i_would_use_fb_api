/*
Dear whom may it concerned,

This is Jung Hyo Sun, an academic researcher at INSEAD in France.
I was hoping to access archival data of public pages such as McDonalds, BurgerKing, and etc. to figure out their uploading patterns. My primary concern is regarding
- when the page was created
- when the first posting was uploaded
It would be great if I an permitted to use an api for this.

Asking for 'Instagram Public Content Access' and 'oembed read' was just a mistake, I am happy with basic authority.

Sincerely,
Jung Hyo Sun
